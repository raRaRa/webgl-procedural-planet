# WebGL Procedural Planet #

An experiment I did back in 2016. You can run any web server on the web directory, e.g. `python -m http.server`, and open the dir `demo` or `demo_quadtree`.

Please feel free to clone or contribute to this project. The dream was to create a mini game that happens on the surface on the planets.
